<p>I am a software engineer at Databricks.</p>
<p>I earned my B.S. in Mathematics and M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University. During my time at Stanford, I ran logistics for <a href="https://stanfordesp.org/">Stanford Splash</a> and the <a href="https://www.stanfordmathtournament.com/">Stanford Math Tournament</a>. Both organizations create valuable educational opportunities for students in the Bay Area, and I'm grateful to have been a part of them.</p>
<p>Before Databricks, I worked at Facebook, Stanford AI Lab, and miscellaneous startups, focusing primarily on machine learning systems and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach me via email at ding (dot) matthew7 (at) gmail. You can also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-ding/">connect with me</a> or check out my <a href="https://github.com/mattyding">GitHub</a> for examples of my work. Some projects I'm particularly proud of include <a href="https://github.com/mattyding/llama.pi">llama.pi</a> which optimizes the forward pass of Llama2 to run on r/pi, and <a href="https://github.com/TheQuantumFractal/CS349D">Flexitrain</a>, a fault-tolerant, data-parallel training framework built atop Pytorch.</p>
