<p>I am a software engineer at Databricks.</p>
<p>I earned my B.S. in mathematics and M.S. in computer science from Stanford University. While there, I ran logistics for Stanford Splash and the Stanford Math Tournament. Prior to Databricks, I worked at Facebook, Stanford AI Lab, and various startups, specializing in machine learning systems and fault tolerance.</p>
<p>I am reachable via email at ding (dot) matthew7 (at) gmail. You can also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-ding/">connect with me</a> or check out my <a href="https://github.com/mattyding">GitHub</a> for examples of my work. Some projects I'm particularly proud of include <a href="https://github.com/mattyding/llama.pi">llama.pi</a> which optimizes the forward pass of Llama2 to run on r/pi, and <a href="https://github.com/TheQuantumFractal/CS349D">Flexitrain</a>, a fault-tolerant, data-parallel training framework built atop Pytorch.</p>
